<!-- // Play rock, paper scissors against the computer that keeps going until someone wins 5 games.
//
// It should take a user input of ‘rock’, ‘paper’, or ‘scissors’ as a parameter
// The Computer should randomly draw rock, paper or scissors
// You need to keep count of wins, losses and ties until someone wins.
// You need to validate the input from the user to make sure they don't type in "BOMB" or "123", also be aware of capitalization of "Scissors" etc...
// Bonus if you can look ahead to create a simple scoreboard with jQuery -->
