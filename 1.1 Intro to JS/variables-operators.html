    // EXERCISE 1:
    // Create a variable to hold the user input from the prompt.
    const favoriteFood = prompt("What is your favorite food?");
    const output = `my favorite food is ${favoriteFood}`;
    console.log(output);

    // console.log this sentence into the console:
    // "My favorite food is -----." using the answer from the prompt

    // EXERCISE 2:
    // Create a variable with the starting value of 0.
    // Add 1 to the current value of that variable,

    let variable1 = 1;
    let speech = `I baked a cookie and I have ${variable1} cookies`;
    console.log(speech);
    variable1 = variable1 - 1;
    speech2 = `I ate a cookie and I have ${variable1} cookies`;
    console.log(speech2);


    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I baked a cookie. Now I have -- cookie."

    // Subtract 1 from the current value of the variable,
    // then (once again) re-assign the new value to the same variable.

    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I just ate a cookie. Now I have -- cookies left."
